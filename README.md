## üîç Introduction
This is a Web3-based decentralized voting application built with Ethereum, Solidity, Hardhat, React, and IPFS. It allows users to securely cast votes through a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. IPFS is used to store immutable records and assets off-chain, and Oracle integration supports real-world event validation on Layer 2.
<br>
## üß± Tech Stack
Frontend: React, JavaScript, Bootstrap
<br>
Blockchain: Solidity, Hardhat, Ethereum (RPC)
<br>
Off-chain Storage: IPFS
<br>
Oracle: Chainlink / L2 Oracle Protocols
<br>
Smart Contract Deployment & Testing: Hardhat
<br>
Wallet Integration: MetaMask / Web3-compatible wallets
<br>

## ‚ú® Features
1. Admin and Voting Panels
<br>
2. Smart Contract-based vote casting
<br>
3. Event listening for VoteCast
<br>
4. Off-chain IPFS-based voter proof archival
<br>
5. Oracle-integrated real-world data validation
<br>
6. L2 interoperability and gas optimization
<br>
7. Secure, transparent election process
<br>

## üì¶ IPFS Integration
### What is IPFS?
IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, and data in a peer-to-peer network.
<br>
### Why use IPFS in this DApp?
1. Decentralized file storage
<br>
2. Permanent, tamper-proof data
<br>
3. Cryptographic hashes for integrity
<br>
4. Reduces gas by storing large data off-chain
<br>

### Use cases in this project:
<br>
1. Store candidate's party image<br>
2. Retrieve and display IPFS content via https://ipfs.io/ipfs/{CID}
<br>

### Example flow:
1. Admin uploads a manifesto PDF or campaign media to IPFS. (For example, candidate's party's logo)<br>
2. IPFS returns a content hash (CID)<br>
3. CID is stored in the blockchain smart contract<br>
4. Frontend fetches the file via public IPFS gateways<br>

## üõ∞Ô∏è Layer 2 Blockchain Oracle Integration
### What are Oracles?
Oracles bridge the gap between on-chain and off-chain data. They fetch, verify, and relay external data (like timestamps, identity checks, or event triggers) into smart contracts.

### Why Oracle + L2?
1. Lower gas fees (via L2 solutions like Arbitrum/Optimism)<br>
2. Real-world conditional logic (e.g., ‚Äúvoting closes 10 minutes after real-world event X‚Äù) <br>
3. External API or timestamp validation<br>
4. Resilience and scalability<br>

### Use cases in this project:
1. Fecth and dispalay the logo image of the candidates' party
